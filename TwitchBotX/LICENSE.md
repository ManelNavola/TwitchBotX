# Twitch Bot X, Twitch-focused Java implementation of PircBotX

*The following code uses PircBotX [https://github.com/pircbotx/pircbotx](https://github.com/pircbotx/pircbotx), which is forked from the PircBot framework. This program is an incomplete implementation of Twitch events into an IRC bot via parsing the tags in the IRC messages, and is at the moment tailored to fit only the needs of MCInteractive, a Minecraft plugin*
